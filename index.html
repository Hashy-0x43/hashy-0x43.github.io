				The Eco-Revolutionary's Complacency Rejection<br />
				(Manifesto & Doctrine) [Rough Draft]
			</h3><br />
		</center>

		<p>
			No longer will there be a Social Democratic revolution; peacefully
			protesting the trivial while we threaten to resemble Venus because useful
			idiots, manipulated by political commentators, opinion hosts, and other
			charlatans for the profiteering gluttons setting our home & God’s creation
			ablaze for their unquenchable thirst, elect useful idiots they
			think will serve their ridiculous ideologies in which they don’t even
			understand.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we continue down this spiral. we will not make it... so naturally cold
			calculation at the sacrifice of our ego is inevitable. Something many
			powerful men before me understood is the important relationship between
			Fear & Love, Coercion & Persuasion. Now violence is not something
			particularly looked upon in favor among modern society as we’ve moved
			passed such manner when resolving conflicts. So unfortunately, we must
			borrow a tactic from our Social Democratic counterparts, Persuasion.
			However, coercion is not off the table.
		</p>
		<p>
			We must appeal to logos for the Rationals, ethos for the People, & pathos
			for the humans. But we must never forget; For proper and effective
			persuasion, you must be honest, straight-forward, & knowledgeable. A
			willingness to educate in layman's terms, for brevity is the soul of wit,
			without breaking your cool & being prepared for bad faith actors is
			incredibly important.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometimes you must play like the Big Boys. With conspiracy, secrecy, &
			dirt. You mustn’t be a hypocrite, remember to be honest. Beat your enemies
			to the exposé. Confess! Confess! Confess!
		</p>
		<p>
			Never, ever! forget where power truly resides, the Proles. To win, you
			absolutely must Unify the Proletariat.
		</p>
		<p>
			To suppress or leave your humanity will separate you from your Faithful.
		</p>
		<p>
			As The Mentor once said "we are in the age of the electron & the switch"...
			So why is oil refusing its inevitable death in the natural march of
			Progression and why do we allow the old to stifle humanity? We've long
			passed the age of elderly wisdom.
		</p>
		<p>
			The equilibrium has been broken, our time is almost up, and public
			discourse is in a constant state of turmoil. There are cardinal sins that
			must be avoided like death, to sway the public effectively. For now I
			mention four:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				DO NOT BREAK YOUR COOL! As you might well know, in recent years
				there has been a concerning surge of entertainment in national news
				media. Opinion Host exist and so do Political Commentators.
			</li>
			<li>
				You must present yourself with a particular etiquette.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be educated on the subject matter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not get personal unless absolutely relevant.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			You are the Arbiter of your life.
